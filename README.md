# Dynamic-Model-Implementation-for-Smart-Solid-Waste-Collection
Definition of a smart solid waste collection system. The implementation is done considering a dynamic approach for the collection of municipal garbage and exploits the information from smart bins to monitor the level of waste filling in the model of the city. A simulation is realized in order to compare the behavior of the proposed smart approach with the static policy employed by many waste collection operators today (fixed routes and predetermined pick-up frequencies). The project was developed for the Dystributed Systems course (Mechatronics Engineering, university of Trento). The model implementation and the simulation are discussed in the pdf "Smart_Waste_Collection".
The proposed smart waste collection system and the MATLAB scripts are presented in the "Distributed_Dynamic_Model" folder.
The "comparison.m" file permits to visualise the results of the simulations of the smart approach and the static policy which have been compared considering the overall produced waste and the total time for the refusal collection.
